This directory is devoted only to the MATLAB functionn and files that I made and will make in the future, I hope you find them useful.

Not all files have instructions on how to properly use them or have instructions in italian, but they are fairly straightforward, if I was able to made them with a very basic knowledge of MATLAB you, an individual which is probably more accustomed with MATLAB than me when I made them, should be able to figure out how they work.
However I will try to provide instructions whenever I have the chance to, please email me at fcapelizza@gmail.com if you have any problems.

When it comes to using classes with MATLAB it is very easy, you have to import it, this process is made incredibly easy if you have the class file (dark-orange colour) in the directiory you are working in, you have have to type an name and set said name as equal to the class that the m file defined.

The .m file called class_use_example will provide you with an example of that.

For advices on codes and corrections/updates on them please contact me at fcapelizza@gmail.com .
