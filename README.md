# ChemE-Stuff
This is a repository in which I will upload a number of files, MATLAB/Python/excel/... codes, explanations that I either made or found and thought that they were fairly useful (EG not a GIF of a cat playing with a dog, but maybe a mouse playing in a chemical plant and getting suffocated by chlorine gas) during my ongoing academic journey in the field of chemical engineering.

I hope you find them as useful as they were to me.

For any code improvement and advices please email me at fcapelizza@gmail.com, I'm new to GitHub and your request may lay unseen for tons of time, so, until I become less shitty at this, please email me.

All the best with your present and future endeavours,

Federico Pelizza.
